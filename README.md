Teach Mycroft knowledge and humor.

## About
This Skill helps to give Mycroft a personality by learning any new information that you provide.
if mycroft not understood mycroft you. you can immediately train the previous request by saying "I want to explain it" or "houmor is probably not your strength".
then you do not have to do everything from the beginning.

## Examples
* "Do you want to learn something"
* "Do you already know this"
* "There you can learn something"
* "I show you something"
* "can you keep a secret"
* "I tell you something private"
* "Please do not say what I'm talking about"

* "I want to explain it"
* "houmor is probably not your strength"
